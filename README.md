# Password-Encryption-webapplication
I’m happy to share this Password Encryption Web application project I worked on. 
Password Encryption Web Application Developed a web application for secure password encryption using HTML, CSS, and PHP. Integrated the MD5 hashing function to ensure that user passwords are encrypted before storage. The application provides a user-friendly interface and robust security features to protect sensitive information.
